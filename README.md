# BA Image classifier training

## Setup
This is a Jupyter Notebook and requires a Jupyter Notebook server to be launched.
* To run locally (not recommended unless you have a powerfull computer) use the [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/tensorflow-notebook) with tensorflow installed.
* Recommended way of launching the notebook is using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) just download the notebook from here and upload it into colab

## Run model after training and conversion
To run the model on test data use the [test script](https://github.com/ManhTin/ba-image-classifier-test) which already contains the model which was trained for the thesis.
